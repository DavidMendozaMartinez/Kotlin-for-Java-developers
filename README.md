# Kotlin for Java developers

Kotlin for Java developers pathway.

## Description

Kotlin is 100% interoperable with Java, so you can include as little or as much Kotlin code in your app as you want. Through the articles and codelabs in the [Kotlin to Java learning pathway](https://developer.android.com/courses/pathways/kotlin-for-java), you can learn how to write idiomatic Kotlin code, add Kotlin to an existing app, and make it seamlessly callable from your Java code. Youâ€™ll also see how Android Studio can help you convert Java code to Kotlin code.
